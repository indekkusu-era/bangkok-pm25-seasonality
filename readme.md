# Seasonality Detection for Bangkok PM2.5 Data using Fast Fourier Transform

This project aims to study the **Bangkok PM2.5 Yearly Crisis** via Seasonality Detection. The proposed method is to use the **Fast Fourier Transform** to approximate the formula of **Bangkok Concentration of PM2.5**.

We used the data from [Bangkok Air Quality Dataset in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadapamettapun/bangkok-airquality). And self-written utilities. All analysis and process explanation will be provided in [main.ipynb](./main.ipynb).
